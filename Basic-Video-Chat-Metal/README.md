Basic Video Chat with Metal sample app
===========================

The Basic Video Chat with Metal app is a very simple application meant to get a new developer
started using the OpenTok MacOS SDK.


Steps to build & run:

1. Create a Vonage Video API Account
2. Get an APIKey, Session-ID, Token from Vonage video playground
3. Add these details to ViewController.m and run the sample
4. You can have a two-party video call with the video playground as the second participant.

Notes:

This sample assumes there are only 2 participants in the call. If more than 1 subscriber joins, the behaviour is unexpected.
